# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

Just completed Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, using this repo to keep a record of all my completed coursework and related files. I will start writing up on each topic with additional links I have been learning from.

Please observe the Coursera honour code.

Currently, these are not standalone Jupyter Notebook, I will try to add some of the dependencies back later as I tidy up the whole set. I will fix broken images too.

I will also add quiz answers eventually too.

## Running your own Jupyter Notebook online (free for 2 months)

Use One-click "Machine Learning and AI" image on DigitalOcean to play around with Python using Jupyter Notebook. Use my referral link and receive $10 in credit immediately as new user, enough to run a small 1GB-RAM 25GB-SSD server for 2 months, $5 a month after. Let me know if you need help with the setup.

I get some free credit (not cash) to run my server there if you sign up using the link.

If you are in mainland China or can't access YouTube, can try to watch the videos on [NetEase 网易云课堂](http://mooc.study.163.com/university/deeplearning_ai#/c).

## Beyond Deep Learning Specialization

* **[Awesome Python Machine Learning](https://github.com/eplt/deep-learning-coursera-complete/blob/master/awesome-python-machine-learning.md)**
I have added a long list of Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources for Machine Learning. Inspired/Forked from [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python), [awesome-machine-learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning).
