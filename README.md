# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

Just completed Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, using this repo to keep a record of all my completed coursework and related files. I will start writing up on each topic with additional links I have been learning from.

Please observe the Coursera honour code.

Currently, these are not standalone Jupyter Notebook, I will try to add some of the dependencies back later as I tidy up the whole set. I will fix broken images too.

I will also add quiz answers eventually too.
